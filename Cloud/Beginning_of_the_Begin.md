# Base concepts
 

## What is DevOps?

> - DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices and tools that enhance a company's ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity, optimizing and improving products at a faster pace than companies using traditional software development processes and infrastructure management.  
> - By implementing a DevOps model, engineers work throughout the entire application lifecycle, from development and testing to deployment and operations, and develop a variety of skills not limited to a single role. When security is the top priority for everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.   
> - These teams use practices to automate processes that have historically been manual and slow. They use a stack of technology and tools that help them operate and develop applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that would normally require the help of other teams, and this further increases the team's velocity.

> ### Benefits of DevOps

> - **Speed** : Operate at high speed so you can bring innovation to customers faster, adapt better to dynamic markets and become more efficient at driving business results.  
	- *How?* The DevOps model enables for developers and operations teams to achieve these outcomes by allowing them to take responsibility for processes/services.  

> - **Fast delivery** : Increase the frequency and pace of releases so you can innovate and improve your product faster.   
	- *How?* Continuous integration and continuous delivery are practices that can be used to automate the software release process, from the design phase to the deployment phase.  


> - **Reliability** : Ensure the quality of application updates and infrastructure changes so you can confidently deliver at a faster pace while maintaining a positive experience for end users.   
	- *How?* Using practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to test that each of your changes works and is secure. Monitoring and logging practices help you stay informed about real-time performance.

> - **Scalability**  : Operate and manage your infrastructure and development processes at scale.   
	- *How?* Automation and constancy help to manage complex or dynamic systems efficiently and with reduced risk.  

> - **Improved collaboration** : Create more efficient teams in a DevOps cultural model that emphasizes values ​​like ownership and responsibility.   
	- *How?* Developer and operations teams collaborate closely, share many responsibilities, and combine their workflows. This reduces inefficiencies and saves time.  

> - **Security** : Operate quickly while maintaining control and maintaining compliance.   
	- *How?* Using automated compliance policies, fine-grained controls, and configuration management techniques. 


> ### DevOps Best Practices

> **Continuous integration**
>> Is a software development practice where developers often pull their code changes together in a central repository. After that, builds and tests are performed. The main goals of continuous integration are to find and investigate bugs faster, improve software quality, and reduce the time required to validate and release new software updates.    

> **Continuous delivery**
>> Is a software development practice in which code changes are automatically created, tested, and prepared for release to production. It expands on a continuous integration basis by deploying all code changes to a test environment and/or production environment after the build stage. When continuous integration is implemented properly, developers will always have a build artifact ready to deploy that has passed a standardized testing process.  

> **Microservices**
>> Is a design approach for building a single application as a set of small services. Each service runs in its own process and communicates with other services through a well-defined interface using a lightweight mechanism, usually an HTTP-based application programming interface (API). Microservices are built around enterprise resources, and each service has a unique purpose. It's possible to use different frameworks or programming languages ​​to write microservices and deploy them independently as a single service or a group of services.


> **Infrastructure as code**
>> Is a practice where infrastructure is provisioned and managed using code and software development techniques such as version control and continuous integration. The cloud's API-driven model allows the interaction with the infrastructure programmatically and at scale, rather than having to manually install and configure resources. Therefore, engineers can talk to the infrastructure using code-based tools and treat it similarly to application code. Because they are defined by code, infrastructure and servers can be quickly deployed using regulatory standards, updated with the latest patches and versions, or duplicated multiple times.  
>> It's also possible to automate operating system and host configuration, operational tasks, and much more. Using code makes configuration changes repeatable and standardized. This relieves developers and system administrators of having to manually configure operating systems, system applications, or server software. As long with this standardization, it's possible to monitor and enforce compliance dynamically and at scale. Therefore, the infrastructure, which is described by the code, can be automatically tracked, validated and reconfigured. This makes it easier for companies to manage resource changes and ensure that security measures are properly applied in a distributed fashion. 

> **Monitoring and logging**
>> Monitoring metrics and logs is useful to see how application and infrastructure performance affects the end-user experience of a product. By capturing, categorizing, and analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, it's possible to understand how changes or updates affect users, which provides insight into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes. As services must be available 24/7 and the application and infrastructure update frequency increases, active monitoring becomes increasingly important. Creating alerts or running real-time analytics on this data also helps to more proactively monitor services.  


> **Communication and collaboration**
>> Increase these two concepts is one of the key cultural aspects of DevOps. Using DevOps tools and automating the software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically linking development and operations workflows and responsibilities. Building on this, these teams set strong cultural norms around information sharing, as well as facilitating communication through the use of chat applications, issue or project tracking systems, and wikis. This helps streamline communication between developers, operations, and even other teams like marketing or sales, allowing all parts of the business to more closely align with goals and projects.

## What is a container?

- It's a standard way to package source code, dependencies and configurations of an application in a single object. They share the same operational system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes. This allows fast, reliable and consistent deployments regardless of the environment.
